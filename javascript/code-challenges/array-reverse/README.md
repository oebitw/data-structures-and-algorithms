# Array Reverse 

This is a program that takes an array and  revers it without using built in methods.

## Challenge

Reverse an array without using a built in method/function.

## Approach & Efficiency
I looped over the array from the last index to index 0 and i pushed the index to a an empty array which will include the same original array but reversed.

I used O(n) notation because I'm using for loop here, and it is a liner time so
O(n) will perform better in speed and time.
